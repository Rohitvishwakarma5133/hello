# Personal Touch Feature Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Description
- Changed from: "Responses tailored to match your natural writing style."
- Changed to: "Unlock advanced humanization with richer tone and vocabulary"

### 2. Added Premium Authentication Logic
- Added `useRouter` from Next.js navigation
- Added state variables for user authentication:
  - `isLoggedIn`: Boolean to track if user is authenticated
  - `isPremium`: Boolean to track if user has premium access

### 3. Implemented Authentication Check
- Added `useEffect` to check localStorage for authentication tokens on component mount
- Checks for `authToken` and `userPlan` in localStorage
- Updates state based on stored values

### 4. Added Upgrade Button Functionality
- Created `handleUpgradeClick` function that:
  - Redirects to `/login` page if user is not logged in OR not premium
  - Allows selection of Personal Touch only if user is both logged in AND premium
  - Uses `router.push('/login')` for programmatic navigation

### 5. Updated Personal Touch Option
- Removed the `onClick` handler from the container div
- Added `onClick={handleUpgradeClick}` specifically to the Upgrade button
- This prevents the option from being selected by clicking anywhere in the container

### 6. Enhanced Login Page
- Updated login form submission to set demo authentication tokens
- Sets `authToken` to 'demo-token-123'
- Sets `userPlan` to 'premium' for demonstration purposes

### 7. Added Development Helper Tools
- Added development-only helper buttons (only visible in development mode)
- Buttons to simulate different authentication states:
  - "Login (Free)" - Sets logged in but not premium
  - "Login (Premium)" - Sets logged in and premium
  - "Logout" - Clears all authentication data

## How It Works

### User Not Logged In
1. User clicks "Upgrade" button on Personal Touch
2. System checks `isLoggedIn` state (false)
3. Redirects user to `/login` page
4. After login, user gets premium access and can use Personal Touch

### User Logged In But Not Premium
1. User clicks "Upgrade" button on Personal Touch  
2. System checks `isLoggedIn` (true) and `isPremium` (false)
3. Redirects user to `/login` page (could be updated to redirect to pricing page instead)

### User Logged In And Premium
1. User clicks "Upgrade" button on Personal Touch
2. System checks `isLoggedIn` (true) and `isPremium` (true)
3. Selects "Personal Touch" style and closes dropdown
4. User can now use the premium feature

## Testing

### Method 1: Use Development Helper Buttons
1. Start the development server
2. Look for the helper buttons in the top-right corner
3. Test different states:
   - Click "Logout" then try the upgrade button → should redirect to login
   - Click "Login (Free)" then try the upgrade button → should redirect to login  
   - Click "Login (Premium)" then try the upgrade button → should select Personal Touch

### Method 2: Use Login Page
1. Go to `/login` page
2. Fill out the form and submit
3. System will set premium tokens automatically
4. Navigate back to home page
5. Try the Personal Touch upgrade button → should work

### Method 3: Manual localStorage Testing
1. Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
2. Clear all items
3. Try upgrade button → should redirect to login
4. Set: `authToken: "test"` and `userPlan: "basic"`
5. Refresh page and try upgrade button → should redirect to login
6. Change `userPlan` to "premium"
7. Refresh page and try upgrade button → should select Personal Touch

## File Changes

### Modified Files:
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main changes to Personal Touch functionality
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Added token setting for demo

### Added Features:
- User authentication state management
- Premium feature gating
- Login redirect functionality
- Development testing helpers

## Production Considerations

1. **Remove Development Helpers**: The helper buttons should be removed or hidden in production
2. **Real Authentication**: Replace localStorage demo logic with real authentication system
3. **Pricing Page**: Consider redirecting non-premium users to pricing page instead of login
4. **Error Handling**: Add error handling for authentication failures
5. **Loading States**: Add loading states during authentication checks
6. **Security**: Implement proper JWT token validation and refresh logic

## Next Steps

To fully implement this feature in production:

1. Integrate with real authentication provider (Auth0, Firebase, etc.)
2. Add proper user context/provider for global state management
3. Implement proper premium subscription logic
4. Add analytics tracking for upgrade button clicks
5. Consider A/B testing different upgrade messaging
6. Add proper error boundaries and fallbacks
